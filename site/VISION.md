# Vision
Syna Theme Starter is a community project. From our current viewpoint, its role is:
This project thrives make it easy to get started with Syna.

## Core Concept
Built a bare bones starter repository to enable easier starting with Syna.

## General Aim
The Syna starter repository provides a basic solution to easily get up and running.

## Communication
A lot of discussion about Syna Theme Starter happens within Github issues. Ideally, we will keep it that way until Syna Theme Starter becomes big enough that this turns into a problem. The advantages of this is that all documentation and issues are publicly searchable and easily linked to the source code.

## Contributions
The Syna Theme Starter project should always aim to devote a lot of time to making contributors feel like an important part of the community. We should strive to provide a place for anyone to be able to contribute. The aim of the core team should be to work on ways to showcase contributions, encourage adoption and show off great work. An example of where this worked is the [CocoaPods Quality Index](http://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods.org-Two-point-Five/).
