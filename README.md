## Summary
Seqoli is a 'DAW-less' midi sequencer interface designed to run on one or more ROLI Lightpad BLOCKS. Drawing inspiration from Monome grid, Seqoli is great for creating polyrhythms on the fly or sequencing an entire track. Snap together multiple Lightpad BLOCKS to extend your sequencer length and/or track count.
